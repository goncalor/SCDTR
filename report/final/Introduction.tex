\section{Introduction}

A real efficient lighting solution must be able to accomodate different lighting requirements in different areas, must take into account external lighting in each area and must be able to understand the light interferences between different areas.

The Distributed Lighting Problem consists of finding the optimal way to control a set of illuminaries to keep the illuminance at a desired value. These illuminaires may correspond to different desks or areas which migh have different lighting requirements. The system must present optimal behaviour not only in terms of energy efficiency but also in terms of response speed to changes and confort to the final user. On top of all this a distributed solution when compared to a centralized one presents many benefits. This is the problem we prupose to solve.
