\subsection{Server}
\label{sec:Server}

The Server in this system has 3 main goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow a client to send commands and change the state of the lights.
    \item Allow a client to inspect the system, sending them statistics about energy consumption and confort of the user.
    \item Run the Simplex implementation and send the results as commands to each arduino.
\end{itemize}

The Server is an interface between clients and the arduinos controlling each light, with the clients it communicates via TCP/IP and with the arduinos it uses a serial connection using the I$^2$C/TWI protocol.






The Server was implemented in C++ using the C++ Standard Library and the \emph{Boost ASIO} Library \cite{BoostSite}
