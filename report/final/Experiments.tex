\section{Experiments}

To analyze the resulting system 3 metrics were implemented (as specified on the assignment):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy: the energy consumed at each desk assuming 1W power.
%$$ E = \sum_{i=2}^{N} d_{i-1}(t_{i-1}-t_i) $$

    \item Confort error: the average error between the reference illuminance and the measured
illuminance for the periods when the measured illuminance is below the reference.

    \item Confort variance: the average variation of the illuminance during periods of constant occupation computed by and approximation to the second derivative of the illuminance.
\end{itemize}

We used these metrics to evaluate system performance on our experiments
