\subsection{Simplex}
\label{sec:Simplex}

The Simplex algorithms solves Linear programms, it finds the optimal solution if it exists.
We implemented the simplex following the pseudo-code on the book \emph{Introduction to Algorithms} \cite{Cormen}.
This implementation solves Linear programms of the form:

$$ min $$




Note: To throughly test the Simplex implementation a series of simple unit tests were constructed using the \emph{Boost Test} Library.
