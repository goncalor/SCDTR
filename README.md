# SCDTR 
This project is a demonstration of the local illumination control for the first semester of SCDTR at IST. It exemplifies the ability to set LED dimming values, read illuminance values in Lux, define setpoints for local control, demonstrate the performance of the control system in step changes in the reference setpoint and under external disturbances.

This repo contains the files used to solve the labs and project of this course.

## Things  left to do:

* At setup get E and O matrices;
* Implement Simplex in MATLAB;
* Implement Simplex in Arduino;
* Implement Distributed simplex or similar algorithm to solve linear program
* Put the global controler working with simplex
* Implement responses to change in response to changes in O
